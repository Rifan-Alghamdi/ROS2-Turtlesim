# ROS2 Turtlesim Task üê¢

![ros2_showcase](images/ros2_showcase.png)

## üß† About the Project

This project demonstrates basic interaction with the [Turtlesim](https://docs.ros.org/en/ros2_packages/foxy/api/turtlesim.html) package in ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). It was created as part of a summer training program to explore the fundamental components of ROS2 such as nodes, topics, and keyboard-based teleoperation.

Through this task, we:
- Launched a simulation window with a turtle avatar.
- Controlled the turtle in real time using keyboard arrows.
- Monitored active ROS2 topics and nodes in the system.
- Observed how commands are published and how ROS2 reacts live.

This simulation offers a simple yet powerful introduction to robotics software architecture and control.

## üê¢ Turtle Simulation Window

Below is the main turtlesim GUI window that shows the turtle in motion. The turtle was moved using arrow keys to trace a square path.

## üìú ROS2 Topics and Nodes

The following image shows the result of running terminal commands to list all active topics and nodes. These help us understand how data flows in ROS2.

## ‚úÖ How to Run This Task

Follow these steps to reproduce the project setup:

### 1. Set up Virtual Machine
- Install VirtualBox and Ubuntu MATE (recommended for lightweight performance).
- Enable copy-paste and shared folder access (install Guest Additions if needed).

### 2. Update the Systemsudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

### 3. Install ROS2 (Humble)
Follow official instructions from: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

> Ensure environment variables are sourced correctly.

### 4. Run TurtleSim Node
Open a terminal and run:ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
This launches the turtle simulation GUI.

### 5. Control the Turtle with Keyboard
Open another terminal and run:ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
Use arrow keys to move the turtle. Try to trace basic shapes like a square or triangle.

### 6. View Active Topics
In any terminal:ros2 topic list

### 7. View Active Nodesros2 node list
